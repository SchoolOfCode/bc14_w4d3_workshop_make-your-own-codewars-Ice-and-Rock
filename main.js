Look outside! ...it's been snowing for three days straight. You know what that means... It's time to go powder skiing! 
But first, you need to grab the correct bag with your equipment in. Write a script to search through all five of your 'gearBags' to find your 'powder skis' and return the correct bag 

Note: you must use the `find` method to locate your bag...!
